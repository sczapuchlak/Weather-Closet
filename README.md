# weatherClosetFinal
This Program is designed to take any location that the user desires, finds the location
using Wunderground API, with a registered key, and tracks down the temperature and weather conditions 
for that location. This is prototype one. I have started drawing up prototype two and have even put some of
the gui for prototype two in this version. Radio buttons for male and female option will be added next time. Radio
buttons for including /excluding accessories have been added onto this version (gui only), and will be working for the next
prototype :)
